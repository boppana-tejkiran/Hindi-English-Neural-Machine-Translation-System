# Hindi-English-Neural-Machine-Translation-System-using-PyTorch

In this project, a Hindi to English Neural Machine Translation(NMT) system is implemented by using different Machine Translation architectures to automate the translation of Hindi sentences into English sentences using PyTorch in Python.

The train and test data (Hindi Sentences) are present in **Dataset** directory and NMT-Models are present in **Models** folder.

Following are the different Neural Machine Translation architectures and models that are implemented:
* Sequence to Sequence (Encoder-Decoder) based Architecture
  Models implemented:
  * Sequence to Sequence Model with unidirectional LSTM RNN
  * Sequence to Sequence Model with bidirectional LSTM
  * Sequence to Sequence model with attention mechanism
* Transformer based Architecture

Details about the implementation of models and their performance is explained in **NMT Report.pdf** file present in the repository.

The auto translated English sentences generated by Transformer model for the testset (Hindi sentences) are present in **Translation result** folder
